excerpt: A nice meta blog post about how to blog

I will also link to https://www.odoo.com/app/blog for anyone looking to set up a free blog. It's a little bit intimidating because it has full business management features, but if you just stick to blog it is free. I would recommend when you start going through the website wizard, to instead click 'Skip and start from scratch', as it trys to set you up with a business styled website that is unnecessary in my opinion. [Here](https://bird-blog.odoo.com/) is one I set up in about 10 minutes, I haven't done much styling but as you can see it has all the fundamentals. I like it because it is using open source software, and they let you host it on the free tier, but if you ever want to move to self hosting that is very doable. The only feature that I have found that isn't free is the mailing list feature, which requires a subscription, or self hosting, but that also has associated costs and difficulties. 

Alternatively I will make my blog public on github, so that those more tech savvy can just clone it and make it their own. I am currently hosting it on Vercel, however I plan to self host in the future.
