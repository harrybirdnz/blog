## Hello

I am Harry, based in Wellington, New Zealand. I am creating this blog site so that I can practice my writing skills, particularly in response to the world around me.

I see writing as an incredibly powerful tool in developing critical thinking skills, and often when I am struggling to conceptualise something, writing it down helps me get my head around it.

It is also a partly response to Nathan Laundry's recent [Substack Post](https://nathanlaundry.substack.com/p/everyone-should-have-a-blog) where he articulates the power of the web to be used to collate resources and share ideas on a person to person level. I think this is incredibly powerful, and owing to the overwhelming amount of information present in the world, what we are exposed to is inevitably filtered. The actual content we consume is therefore determined entirely by our choice of filter. For the vast majority of people, that filter is an algorithm, an algorithm with goals that are in direct contradiction with your own goals. It wants your time and attention, you want clear and concise information. AI is not much better. While I think there is potential for AI to be used as a custom content filter, in its current configuration it can not be relied upon. This leaves us with one tool. The human filter. In many ways this already exists on algorithmic platforms, through influencer networks, however it is often impossible to distinguish between genuine opinions and paid. The concept however is solid, by sharing our own knowledge, and curating a reliable network of other humans who share theirs, we can distill the vast quantity of information available on the internet into just what is most important to us.
