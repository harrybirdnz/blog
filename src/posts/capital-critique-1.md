![Cover of Capital by Marx](/capital-cover.avif)

This one is the first entry in a series that I will be publishing as I read [Capital by Karl Marx](https://hardcover.app/books/capital). The intent is to respond critically to the analysis introduced by Marx, and to apply it to the modern NZ context.

In all likelihood the ambition of this project is too large, and I am aware that there are many existing texts applying Marxism to the current state of affairs. However in producing this new work, I do not aspire to create anything novel or of unique value, but to develop my own understanding and knowledge to a much greater level than I would achieve simply by reading alone.

In addition, I aspire to complete further advanced studies after this, and so see this work as an essential baseline.

I would also like to add that I am considering producing these texts in [Typst](https://typst.app) as well, which would allow formal sourcing and referencing. Of course the primary source will be Marx's Capital, but in applying this to a NZ context I also intend to expand this to more sources, in particular when analysing material conditions using statistics.

In approaching this text, we must first make some clarifications. Marx analyses capitalism from a philosophical standpoint. Classical economists refuse to engage with the subject in this manner. This is because by approaching economics from a philosphical standpoint, the abstract nature is immediately revealed. To the capitalist, economics must appear as a science, with laws grounded in our physical reality. 

Here also we note that a significant theme of anti intellectualism resurfaces. Anti-intellectualism under capitalism serves the existance of a system that is full of contradictions. In destroying the credibility of social sciences and philosophy, the grounds in which capitalist economics can be critiqued is reduced to economics and finance, thost 'scientific' fields that are controlled by the capitalist ideology and thus do not present a challenge to the structure of the system.

**To treat capitalism as a philosophy is to acknowledge the abstract and temporary nature of the system.**
