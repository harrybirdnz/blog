This is the first entry in a series that I will be publishing as I read [Capital by Karl Marx](https://hardcover.app/books/capital). The intent is to respond critically to the analysis introduced by Marx, and to apply it to the modern NZ context.

In all likelihood the ambition of this project is too large, and I am aware that there are many existing texts applying Marxism to the current state of affairs. However in producing this new work, I do not aspire to create anything novel or of unique value, but to develop my own understanding and knowledge to a much greater level than I would achieve simply by reading alone.

In addition, I aspire to complete further advanced studies after this, and so see this work as an essential baseline.
