As a dual citizen, holding both a NZ and a UK passport, and taking into account the relative spending power of NZ, as well as my qualifications and age, I could move to virtually any country in the world, and I would be able to get a working visa there. One of the few countries in which this is not currently possible is the USA, where the primary visa pathway, the H1b, [now has a $100,000 application fee](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/trumps-100000-visa-shock-the-real-reason-behind-his-h-1b-crackdown-article-153141461). Regardless, the question is still posed. As someone with very few limits on where I can live, where should I pick?

There are a few competing priorities. 
Social
Salary
Job

These are general questions that I am trying to find the answers to in life anyway. In recent years, I have ascribed more and more importance to the social and job aspect, than the salary, and also my definition of the job aspect has changed. Previously it would have been better titled career, as in does this job lead to the career I want.
