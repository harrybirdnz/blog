The people around us have an incredible influence on the way that we live our lives, but how often do we consider the inverse effects that we have on them? A concept that I have been thinking about a lot recently is the network of humans that we are surrounded by. Every one of us comes into contact with a range of other people every day, in a variety of contexts. These contacts significantly affect both our external actions and also our internal moods and feelings.

I was inspired by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQWPPfaNhzc) of Sylvan Franklin's, where he talks about the level of control that we have on our own friend groups, just by what we choose to talk about. An example would be if when you meet up with your friends, all you ever talk about is sport, then you are incentivised to follow the weeks sporting updates so that you will be able to contribute to the conversation the next time you meet up. This realisation allows you (somewhat narcissistically) to influence the behaviour of those around you. For me, I love learning new things off people, and read a lot of non-fiction. My friends know this, so when they read/learn something new they talk to me about it, because I have shown that I am likely to be interested in it in previous interations. In this way I think we all fall into roles in our friend groups, and probably these patterns are rather hard to change once established. Not to say that it's impossible, and also by having these conversations with people, and being excited about the things that excite and interest you, you incentivise people to be more interesting to you specifically. This isn't entirely selfish however, all friend groups operate on commonalities, and often being able to grow and learn together is where we recieve our social rewards, regardless of whether the subject is cars or sports or existentialism.

To sum it up, I will recommend a few non-fiction books that significantly changed the way I viewed the world when I read them. Books that every new idea and insight felt mind blowing, and I was sat there wondering why everyone wasn't talking about this.
