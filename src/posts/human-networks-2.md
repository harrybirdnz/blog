If we accept that the people in our lives have a huge influence on the way that we act, we should be careful when curating the list of humans that we take advice from. This applies both to our personal relationships, but more importantly it extends to the humans that we interact with on the internet.

There is an immense amount of information in the world, far too much for any one person to distill on their own. Even if you limit human knowledge to what has been already distilled by authors and written down in books, the knowledge set still far exceeds what anyone can reasonably expect to learn in their lifetimes. However, in order to make informed decisions, somehow we must absorb and process the relevant information.

This requires another level of distillation, another level of human content filtering, ideally by a subject matter expert. I hypothesise that the way that this occurs in the modern era is through 'influencer' networks. Or more specifically, each of us slowly curates our own personal list of influencers who we trust to advise us in their subject of expertise.

I have identified three reasons why I think this is the case. Firstly, influencers provide variety that mainstream media cannot. What I mean is that mainstream media cannot possibly hope to emulate the kind of specific, tailored, content that is produced by influencers. Influencers have small, niche, audiences, for which it is comparitively easier to tailor content. In comparison, a documentary around healthy living attempts to cater to all stratum of the general populace, and as a result cannot connect on the same level.

In addition, with the current advent of influencer based life advice, it is incredibly easy to find advice that fits into the consumers preexisting worldview. The relationship between influencer and consumer is incredibly fickle, and so we selectively pick and choose what to listen to and what to ignore based on our established notions of the world.

Also, corporations have recognised the power of influencers in recommending lifestyle changes that involve spending money, and as such sponsorship deals flow into the bank accounts of creators advocating these lifestyle shifts. This manifests as the appearance of many more creators encouraging you to buy something than not, which is easily misinterpreted because if more people are arguing that problems can be solved with purchases, then that must be true. In reality, those who provide advice that does not make anyone any money, are not supported financially to do so. For this reason, they cannot create the content full time, and less creators follow this path in general. The online community therefore has a sampling bias where the voices of consumerism are amplified.

I have been observing a recent trend on the internet towards knowledge exchange communities. Owing to our limited capacity for deep knowledge, yet assuming we can each learn deeply on a few topics that are of interest to us, members of these communities will share their knowledge in exchange for access to the knowledge of the other members of the community.

This brings the analysis to the personal relationship. In many ways, this knowledge community is experienced every day with our friend groups. We know that Bob loves the gym, and is always watching and reading new content, so when we want advice on the gym, we ask Bob. We know that Bob has no commercial incentive to tell us anything, he just passes on what works for him based on everything he's learnt. Bob distills the vast quantity of gym advice, tailors it for us, and perhaps he gives a few recommendations as to where to look if we want to know more, based on what he has found useful to him personally.

So in this day and age we curate influencers, based on the accounts we follow. We also curate our friends, based on the attention and care we apply to our friendships. I am arguing that the modern era has lead to an overreliance on influencers over friendships. A priorisation of a commercial relationship over a social one. We should take extra care to analyse the motives of anyone we only interact with in one direction.

This takes me back to my last post, where I recommended a few sources of information I have found valuable. In blogging here, I am simply extending/distilling the ideas of the humans I have interacted with in the past. Therefore by crediting them, I allow anyone silly enough to read this far to go and learn more, if it interests them.

So to end I will link [Nathan Laundry's Substack](https://nathanlaundry.substack.com/) again, which I think is the biggest influence in me actually writing this, and also a demonstration of the power of community in his Digital Cohort which is experimenting with withdrawing from the attention economy.
