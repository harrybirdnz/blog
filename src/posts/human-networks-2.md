If we accept that the people in our lives have a huge influence on the way that we act, we should be careful when curating the list of humans that we take advice from. In this I am talking about the creators on the internet from which we seek advice, although the same concepts do also apply to our personal relationships.

There is an immense amount of information in the world, far too much for any one person to distill on their own. Even if you limit human knowledge to what has been already distilled by authors and written down in books, the knowledge set still far exceeds what anyone can reasonably expect to learn in their lifetimes. However in order to make informed decisions, we must absorb this information somehow. This requires another level of distillation, another level of human content filtering, ideally by a subject matter expert.

> Side note, free market capitalists expect us to always act as a 'rational' 'informed' consumer, which is obviously ludicrous, no one can be perfectly informed about all purchasing decisions.

I hypothesise that the way that this occurs in the modern era is through 'influencer' networks. Or more specifically, each of us slowly curates our own personal list of influencers who we trust to advise us in their subject of expertise.

I think the rise of the influencer is in response to several factors. Firstly, a growing distrust in mass media. Previously mainstream TV shows such as Fair Go might have influenced our purchases, or a health documentary might have provided healthly living advice. However a rise in corporate sponsorships, or more accurately a rise in public awareness of the fallibility of advice, has lead to the decline in this mass line of thought.

In addition, with the current advent of influencer based life advice, it is incredibly easy to find advice that fits into the consumers current worldview. The relationship between influencer and consumer is incredibly fickle, and so we selectively pick and choose what to listen to and what to ignore based on our preexisting notions of the world.

Also, corporations have rightly recognised the power of influencers in recommending lifestyle changes that involve spending money, and as such sponsorship deals flow into the bank accounts of creators advocating these lifestyle shifts. This manifests as the appearance of many more creators encouraging you to buy something than not, which is easily misinterpreted using the wisdom of the crowd bias, that because more people are arguing that problems can be solved with purchases, then that must be true. In reality, those who provide advice that does not make anyone any money, are not supported financially to do so. For this reason, they cannot create the content full time, and less creators follow this path in general. The crowd therefore has a sampling bias where the voices of consumerism are amplified.

The conclusion is however not that all purchases will make your life worse. In this world, we must consume or die, and the only way to acquire is to buy (unless you happen to be living in a self-sufficient off grid commune, but if so, you really don't need to be reading this).

I have been observing a recent trend on the internet towards knowledge exchange communities. Owing to our limited capacity for deep knowledge, yet assuming we can each learn deeply on a few topics that are of interest to us, members of these communities will share their knowledge in exchange for access to the knowledge of the other members of the community.

This brings the analysis to the personal relationship. In many ways, this knowledge community is experienced every day with our friend groups. We know that Bob loves the gym, and is always watching and reading new content, so when we want advice on the gym, we ask Bob. We know that Bob has no commercial incentive to tell us anything, he just passes on what works for him based on everything he's learnt. Bob has distilled the vast quantity of gym content, for us, and perhaps he gives a few recommendations as to where to look if we want to know more, based on what he has found useful and who he thinks gives good advice.

This takes me back to my last post, where I recommended a few sources of information I have found valuable. In blogging here, I am simply extending/distilling the ideas of the humans I have interacted with in the past. Therefore by crediting them, I allow anyone silly enough to read this far to go and learn more, if it interests them.

So to end I will link [Nathan Laundry's Substack](https://nathanlaundry.substack.com/) again, which I think is the biggest influence in me actually writing this, and also a demonstration of the power of community in his Digital Cohort which is aiming to quit the attention economy.
